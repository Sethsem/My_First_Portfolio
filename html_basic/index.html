        <h1>Welcome to My Cool Webpage!</h1>

        <h2>About This Webpage</h2>
        <p>
          This is my very first webpage. It is designed to showcase some basic
          HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, and images. I'm excited to
          share this with you!
        </p>

        <h3>What You Will Find Here</h3>
        <p>
          In this webpage, you'll find some introductory information about the
          project. It also includes links and images that make it visually
          interesting.
        </p>

        <h2>Image Example</h2>
        <p>
          Here's a clickable image. If you click on it, you'll be taken to the
          ALX website!
        </p>

          />
        </a>

        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          This is just the beginning. As I continue learning, I'll add more
          features to my webpage. Stay tuned for more updates!
